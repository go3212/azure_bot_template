# azure_bot_template
In this repository you'll find a nodejs application which is a demonstration of a 'user-support' chat. The application has to serve a purpuse: to be embeddable in a website whilst being fast and sustainable.
 
## What is the main goal?
The main goal is to provide a fast, 'hybrid', embeddable chat application for companies to use in the client-support department. The 'hybrid' part stands for the possibility of implementing a chat-bot which is supervised by a human (when the client really needs human attention).

## Work to do
- [x] Implement a basic chat application.
     - [x] Implement a basic user manager, with basic authentication.
     - [x] Update the website design.

     - [ ] Create modules for boilerplate code. 
     - [ ] Add user to user chat.
     - [ ] User settings and private conversation.
     - [ ] Admin mode and bot mode.
- [ ] Start with the chat-bot development
- [ ] Work in progress...
